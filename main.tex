\chapter{Delvers}

\section{Delvers of Orth}
The champions of this story are the delvers also known as cave raiders. Their mission is to explore the abyss, retrieve its many riches, and discover its many mysterious secrets. However, their descent is fraught with danger and unforeseen encounters, often to their untimely demise. They are considered folk heroes by the \textit{town of Orth}. The town is built around the edge of the abyss. 

\section{Delvers' Whistles}
All delvers (*) are equipped with a whistle. They represents their wearers social status within Orth and their expertise as delvers of the Abyss. Experienced delvers can travel further down without severe consequences. They have a better understanding of the layout and dangers of each of the layers.

In terms of mechanics delvers' rank describe which layers is most appropriate for their level. See table 1.1.

\end{dndtable}
\label{tab:colors}

\header{Whistle Illustrations}

\subsection{Bell Whistles}

\subsection{Red Whistles}

The apprentices. Red Whistles are rookie delvers who have a decent knowledge of the abyss and have descended up to the first layer on their own. It is a common rank for prepubescent kids who have studied since an early age. One obtains a red whistle and the official title of delver after they first descent to the abyss. While they're fairly knowledgeable, red whistles lack the physical fortitude to get very deep, so they're only allowed to descend up to 550 meters. Going any deeper would be treated as an accident or a rebellious behavior, and a rescue party would be sent to retrieve them. If a red whistle somehow managed to descend 1350 meters, it is treated as suicide and search parties are called off. 

\subsection{Blue Whistles}

The adepts. Blue Whistles are more experienced delvers who managed to proved themselves. They're allowed to delve up to the second layer of the abyss, so they most likely possess an acceptable fighting ability to fend off from the beasts of the forest of temptation. Typically and with the appropriate training, one attains the rank of blue whistle at the age of 15, though there are exceptions to this. 

\subsection{Moon Whistles}

The teachers. Moon Whistles are highly proficient delvers that carry an extensive knowledge of the abyss. They can delve up to the third layer safely, so their delving ability is in a completely different level to Blue Whistles. They're considered experienced enough to serve as teachers for the newer generations. 

\subsection{Black Whistles}

The experts. Black Whistles are extremely talented delvers that have mastered the delving techniques of delvers. They can reach up to the fourth layer of the abyss, which is the point in which the strains of ascension can really make one touch insanity. Black Whistles also sometimes work under white whistles as subordinates, and assist them in their expeditions. 

\subsection{White Whistles}

The legends. White Whistles are considered to be the greatest delvers of all. Their achievements have changed the world and their discoveries astonished all, turning into spectacular historical figures. They're named after their unique persona and reach a whole new level incomparable to that of other delvers. They're armed to the teeth with artifacts of the abyss, and represent a formidable force. Because of their status, any information that is officially passed by them is considered a fact, no matter how absurd. 

Only a handful of delvers attain this legendary rank however, and only five white whistles are known:

\header{Current White Whistles}
\begin{dndtable}[lX]
  \textbf{Title} \\
  "The Lord of Annihilation", Lyza the Annihilator \\
  "The Immovable Sovereign", Ozen the Immovable \\
  "The Lord of Dawn", Bondrewd the Novel \\
  "The Lord of Mystery", Srajo the Obscure \\
  "The Lord of Guidance", Wakuna \\
\end{dndtable}

White Whistle don't have any depth limit, however since the strains of ascension make it humanly impossible to survive the ascent from the 6th layer, for most of their life the 5th layer is their limit. At some point when they make the decision, a white whistle will descend to the inviolable 6th layer. Since return from this point is impossible, this descent is called the "Last Dive" and it represents the most important point of their career, delving into largely unknown territory.

\section{Equipment}

\section{Background \& Motives}

Delver's motivations for delving the abyss are varied. Some are drawn to it from a competitive aspect, others for its many wonderous treasures, and others from pure curiosity about its many secrets. What they all have in common is their undying desire to brave the abyss to attain their goal.

\begin{quotebox}
"If it was between dying of old age, or of some stupid thing like a heart attack... I'd want to die exploring the great unknown, and satisfying that urge to see the endless nameless." \newline\textit{Ã˜bserver, a blue whistle}
\end{quotebox}

\chapter{Descending the Abyss}

\section{The Abyss}
In the middle of Orth lies the legendary abyss. It is a circular chasm that is 1 km across. It is a source of great pride and challenge, as well as worship for many of its citizens. Both descending and ascending the abyss is fraught with dangers.

\section{Navigation}
The Abyss is fraught with dangers and is very difficult to navigate. Maps are spotty at best, and information is scarce. Most knowledge is shared from mouth to mouth.

\section{Artifacts}
Artifacts or relics are classified and cataloged according to their power. All artifacts have limited number of uses, often indicated by the strange writings on them. The most powerful artifacts that a white whistle can use are second grade artifacts. Greater artifacts are considered very important to national security and can be found deep within the abyss. 

\begin{quotebox}
	The discovery of a Greater Artifact is a huge ordeal. Experts and White whistles are tasked with their retrieval. These trips are perilous, as such, often come at the great cost of many lives. Greater artifacts are not cataloged, or only partially, to keep them secret from other nations, thus keeping an edge in the power struggle.
\end{quotebox}

\header{Artifact Classes}

  Second Grade Artifact           &  \\
  Third Grade Artifact           &  \\
  Fourth Grade Artifact           &  \\
\end{dndtable}

\section{Dangers \& Creatures}

Delvers diving into the abyss find themselves in a totally different ecosystem compared to the surface world. However, they will also discover themselves no longer on the top of the food chain. 

Delvers who have encountered creatures have categorized them depending on their danger level. The following table describes these levels.

\header{Creature Classes}
\begin{dndtable}[lX]
    \textbf{Class}  & \textbf{Rating} \\
    Harmless    & \FiveStarOpen \\
    Minor   & \FiveStar \\
    Caution & \FiveStar \FiveStar \\
    Serious & \FiveStar \FiveStar \FiveStar \\
    Lethal  & \FiveStar \FiveStar \FiveStar \FiveStar \\
    Irrational  & \FiveStar \FiveStar \FiveStar \FiveStar \FiveStar \\

    Unprecedented   & \FiveStar \FiveStar \FiveStar \FiveStar \FiveStar \FiveStar \FiveStar \\
\end{dndtable}

Not only will delvers meet monstrous creatures, they will also find themselves in conflict with other delvers from foreign countries, looking to cash in on the abyss's treasures. These are considered hostile and should be disposed off.

\chapter{Curse of the Abyss}

\section{Ascending the Abyss}
The abyss harbors a mysterious phenomenon known as the Curse of the Abyss. It manifests when delvers attempt to ascent the abyss. This curse makes ascending a daunting affair, resulting in exhaustion and distress, even for the most seasoned delver. The deeper you go ascend from the more severe the curse's effect will be. The illustrations show some of the curse's effects.

\subsection{Exhaustion Points}
{All delvers start their descent with 0 exhaustion points out of a maximum of 3.}

\subsection{Roll for Exhaustion (2d6)}
{Whenever a delver attempts to ascend a layer of the abyss they must make a (2d6) exhaustion check to determine how many exhaustion points they gain. On a 10 or higher, they gain (+0) exhaustion points, 9 to 7 they gain (+1) point of exhaustion, and on a 6 or lower they gain (+2) points of exhaustion. \newline Should a delver find themselves ascending from beyond their recommended layer they will take (-2) penalty to their roll.}

\subsection{Exhaustion Recovery}
{A delver can recover from this state by taking a long rest. A delver can subtract 1 exhaustion point for each long rest. A delver that reaches the city of Orth can recover all of their exhaustion points after a short rest.}

\subsection{Exhaustion Consequences}
{Should a delver's exhaustion point reach 3, the partial effects of a layer's curse will apply. An affected delver succumbs to their exhaustion - and is unable to move on their own nor perform any actions. They are in a constant state of drifting in and out of consciousness. \newline In the case that their exhaustion point should exceed 3 the effects of the curse will have its full effect on the delver. In the worst case scenario depending on the description of the curse the delver dies.}

The world of Made in Abyss is a fantastic world, however, it is not clear how you would go about adventuring in it. 

\subsection{Missions}
The world is a brutal place, and everyone will eventually be claimed by the abyss. Do you have what it takes to conquer the abyss? Are you willing to make the necessary sacrifices to survive? Only time will tell.
